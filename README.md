Dog Classifier

This is my first image classifier/AI project!

To run, navigate to the directory and in CMD type:
"python check_images --arch <CNN arch (either vgg, resnet, alexnet)> --dir <directory with images> --dogfile dognames.txt"

Results will be printed out on screen, or you can pipe the results to a txt file.
